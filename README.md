This is a small and tidy macOS app that pretty much does one thing - it collects all the text from a directory (and optionally subdirectories) of .swift files and exports the code to a single .txt file. You can set default directories for your xCode projects and where you will be exporting to. Let me know if you see room for improvement, I put this together real quick.

Cheers!
